features:
- title: Automatic Syncing
  details: Subspace takes care of syncing under the hood, syncing exactly what you need when you need it. It saves the state to a local database ensuring the DApp always syncs from the last known point even after reloading the DApp.
- title: Reactive
  details: Subspace embraces reactive programming with RxJS. It provides methods to track and subscribe to events, contract state & balances, and react to changes via observables.
- title: Framework Agnostic
  details: Subspace is framework agnostic and integrates well with your favourite frameworks, from React to Angular. It works in the browser and in nodejs.
